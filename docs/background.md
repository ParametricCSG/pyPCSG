#Background
##JSON
From : http://www.json.org/
* An array is an ordered collection of values. An array begins with [ (left bracket) and ends with ] (right bracket). Values are separated by , (comma).
* A value can be a string in double quotes, or a number, or true or false or null, or an object or an array. These structures can be nested.
* A string is a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters, wrapped in double quotes, using backslash escapes. A character is represented as a single character string. A string is very much like a C or Java string.
* A number is very much like a C or Java number, except that the octal and hexadecimal formats are not used.
* Whitespace can be inserted between any pair of tokens. Excepting a few encoding details, that completely describes the language.
